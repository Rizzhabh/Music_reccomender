Music Genre Recommender System
Project Title: Personalized Music Genre Recommendation using Decision Tree algorithm

. Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that recommends music genres to individuals based on their age, gender, and previously stated preferred music genres. The goal is to provide personalized and relevant genre suggestions, enhancing the user's music discovery experience.



. Data Description:

The core of this project relies on a dataset containing the following features:

Age: Numerical, representing the user's age. This can be either raw age or categorized into age groups (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.) for potentially better generalization.
Gender: Categorical, typically "Male," "Female," "Non-binary," or "Prefer not to say."
Preferred Genre(s): Categorical (could be multi-label), representing the genre(s) the user explicitly states they enjoy. This is the crucial input that helps the model learn individual preferences. Examples include "Pop," "Rock," "Hip Hop," "Electronic," "Classical," "Jazz," "Country," "R&B," etc.
Recommended Genre (Target Variable): Categorical, this will be the output of our model â€“ the genre predicted for a new user. For training, this would be a genre that the user has demonstrated a strong preference for (e.g., through high listening frequency or explicit liking).
